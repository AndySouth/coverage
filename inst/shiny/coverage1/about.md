A simple interactive graphical model to demonstrate how different interventions can be combined to target mosquito vectors exhibiting different behaviours. 

Developed by Andy South and Gerry Killeen in 2016.  

* Select 'UI' to use. 
* Modify inputs using the sliders.
* The coloured square indicates proportions of vectors feeding on humans and livestock, and of those feeding on humans the proportion doing so indoors versus outdoors.
* The vector feeding pie chart shows the proportion of vectors remaining after interventions and what they are feeding on.
* The human exposure pie chart shows the proportion of the total potential vectors that reamin feeding on humans after the interventions.
* The first two sliders allow you to modify the proportions of vectors feeding on livestock and humans indoors and outdoors.


This is an exceedingly simple model based on arithmetic and not directly derived from data. It is based on simple proportions and that interventions target vectors exhibiting different behaviour. In this implementation one intervention (nets) is assumed to target vectors feeding indoors on humans, another (emanators) targets only vectors feeding outdoors on humans and a third (vet insecticides) targets only vectors feeding on livestock.

Of course, in the field the situation will be more complex with vectors being more plastic in their behaviour and interventions targetting more than one of these groups. Nevertheless, the model demonstrates the broad implications of one hypothesis and allows the user to investigate. The model could easily be modified to address alternative hypotheses.

The research behind this model is described in an accompanying submitted paper.
